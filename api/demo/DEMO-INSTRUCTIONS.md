```
Solution: Make scripts executable
> chmod +x *.js
> chmod +x run-all-demos.sh
```

**4. Connection Timeout**
```
Solution: Check if API server is responsive
> curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Debug Mode

For detailed debugging information, set the debug environment variable:

```bash
DEBUG=true node [demo-script].js
```

### API Server Issues

If the API server fails to start:

1. Check port availability: `netstat -an | grep 3000`
2. Kill existing processes: `pkill -f "node.*3000"`
3. Restart with: `cd api && npm start`
