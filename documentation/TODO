DOCUMENTATION:
careful: differentiate between technical code documentation and the professional documentation (conclusions) written from the perspective of an economics institute.

**complete professional documentation: conclusions in 8 topics**
The conclusions should be kept on a conceptual level (except 04 API Endpoint Design) and NOT contain any code snippets. Any Implementation specifics need to be outlined conceptually in the conclusion and for each detailed/technical explanation create a new file in the folder: "documentation/Umsetzung und Implementierung" and linked in the conclusion. Also link references to other conclusions to avoid too much redundancy. 

The conclusions are almost complete, just add any crucial missing information from the resources but do not change the structure (chapters, subchapters,...) of the documents without asking me first - if you think the structure needs to be changed, please discuss it with me first. (I am grateful for any criticism and suggestions for improvement, but I want to be involved in the decision making process.) Also after every topic please stop and let me verify.

for each conclusion:
- make sure to add all sources and references to the file "Quellen und Referenzen"
- no emojis or slang - this is a professional documentation
- if necessary update the file "Konklusion Open API Kundenbeziehung Overview.md" where all the final conclusions are linked and each files structure and content is outlined briefly

also for everything use the following sources as inspiration for best practice implementations and for the structure of the documentation:
