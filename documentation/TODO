DOCUMENTATION:
careful: differentiate between technical code documentation and the professional documentation (conclusions) written from the perspective of an economics institute.

[✓] complete professional documentation: conclusions in 8 topics
The conclusions should be kept on a conceptual level (except 04 API Endpoint Design) and NOT contain any code snippets. Any Implementation specifics need to be outlined conceptually in the conclusion and for each detailed/technical explanation create a new file in the folder: "documentation/Umsetzung und Implementierung" and linked in the conclusion. Also link references to other conclusions to avoid too much redundancy. 
Write the conclusions in 2 parts:
    [✓] Part 1 - almost done: here the conclusions are almost complete, just add any crucial missing information from the resources but do not change the structure (chapters, subchapters,...) of the documents.
        [✓] 01 Marktanalyse:
        - final conclusion file: "documentation/Fachliche Conclusions Open API Kundenbeziehung/01 Marktanalyse.md"
        - COMPLETED: kept structure exactly as is, added missing information from the files in the folder (files are in the subfolders "original sources" and "structured by topic"): "documentation/Fachliche Conclusions Open API Kundenbeziehung/Resources"
        [✓] 02 Anforderungen: 
        - final conclusion file: "documentation/Fachliche Conclusions Open API Kundenbeziehung/02 Anforderungen.md"
        - COMPLETED: kept structure exactly as is, added missing information from the files in the folder (files are in the subfolders "original sources" and "structured by topic"): "documentation/Fachliche Conclusions Open API Kundenbeziehung/Resources"
    [✓] Part 2 - needs more work: for each conclusion there is a draft for the document structure (Inhaltsverzeichnis) and each chapters contents in the folder: "documentation/Fachliche Conclusions Open API Kundenbeziehung/Inhaltsverzeichnisse"
    That structure is too complex though, and needs to be simplified a bit. In the file documentation/OBP Topics and Content.md the most important points for each conclusion are listed. Create texts that are nice to read, easy to understand, but still contain all relevant information and are professionally worded.
        [✓] 03 Referenzprozess: 
        - final conclusion file: "documentation/Fachliche Conclusions Open API Kundenbeziehung/03 Referenzprozess.md"
        - overly complex draft (Inhaltsverzeichnis): "documentation/Fachliche Conclusions Open API Kundenbeziehung/Inhaltsverzeichnisse/03_referenzprozess_inhaltsverzeichnis.md"

        [✓] 04 API-Endpoint Design:
        - final conclusion file: "documentation/Fachliche Conclusions Open API Kundenbeziehung/04 API Endpoint Design.md"

        [✓] 05 Vertrauensnetzwerk:
        - final conclusion file: "documentation/Fachliche Conclusions Open API Kundenbeziehung/05 Vertrauensnetzwerk.md"
        - overly complex draft: "documentation/Fachliche Conclusions Open API Kundenbeziehung/Inhaltsverzeichnisse/05_vertrauensnetzwerk_inhaltsverzeichnis.md"
        - COMPLETED: 
            [✓] create new document structure based on Inhaltsverzeichnis and simplified "OBP Topics and content.md"

        [✓] 06 Consent und Security Flow:
        - final conclusion file: "documentation/Fachliche Conclusions Open API Kundenbeziehung/06 Consent und Security Flow.md"
        - overly complex draft: "documentation/Fachliche Conclusions Open API Kundenbeziehung/Inhaltsverzeichnisse/06_consent_security_flow_inhaltsverzeichnis.md"
        - additional resource that shows a great example of how this topic can be explained and documented: https://docs.airlock.com/iam/latest/index/1639690251538.html
        - COMPLETED: 
            [✓] create new document structure based on Inhaltsverzeichnis and simplified "OBP Topics and content.md"

        [✓] 07 Rechtliche Rahmenbedingungen:

[✓] create a file "Konklusion Open API Kundenbeziehung Overview.md" where all the final conclusions are linked and outline each files structure and content briefly 
[✓] make sure to add all sources and references to the file "Quellen und Referenzen"

use the following sources as inspiration for best practice implementations and for the structure of the documentation:
- https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3.html
- https://docs.airlock.com/iam/latest/index/1639690251538.html

Next steps:
for all conclusions complete the following tasks:
[] add reference links to relevant resources and other conclusions (ideally the specific chapter or section) wherever it makes sense
[] remove all emojis - they are not professional and do not fit the tone of the documentation
[] complete TODOs in the conclusions where possible, but do not remove any TODOs about verification with someone!
[] ensure that the letters ä/ö/ü are represented correctly - currently they are replaced by weird symbols -> ensure that all files are saved in UTF-8 encoding to avoid any issues with special characters
[] for all sections with code snippets (except API-Endpoint Design): Create a new file in the folder "documentation/Umsetzung und Implementierung" and link it in the conclusion. The file should contain the code snippets and a detailed explanation of the code, but not the conclusion itself (link the conclusion at the specific section in the new file). In the conclusion file replace the previous content with a conceptual overview of the topic (find a different way to represent the data points, e.g. create tables). Do not remove mermaid diagrams.
[] ensure that all files are linked correctly and that there are no broken links
[] add a TODO in each conclusion file in the section Fazit/Implikationen/Handlungsempfehlungen/... that says: "TODO: TZE bitte verifizieren!!"
[] at the end of each conclusion file add a link to the "Quellen und Referenzen" file, so that all sources and references are easily accessible
[] ensure that the conclusion files are well-structured, easy to read and follow a consistent format
[] ensure that all conclusions are written in a professional tone and style, avoiding any informal language or slang
[] ensure that all conclusions are comprehensive and cover all relevant aspects of the topic, without being overly verbose or repetitive
[] ensure that all conclusions are aligned with the overall goals and objectives of the Open Banking Platform project
