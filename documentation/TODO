**complete professional documentation: conclusions in 8 topics**
professional documentation (conclusions) written from the perspective of an economics institute

**General guidelines for the conclusions:**
- keep the structure as is, do not change the chapters and subchapters without asking me
- complete TODOs in the files and take the section **context for each conclusion** into account
- do not remove the TODOs in cursive (*TODO: ...*), they are for future verification with experts
- make sure to add all sources and references to the file "Quellen und Referenzen"

**General guidelines for the content:**
- link references to other conclusions to avoid too much redundancy
- everything should be anonymized, so that it is not possible to identify the author or the company. replace names with generic terms like "Bank X","Financial Institution Y", etc. (it should still be clear where the perspective comes from so make sure to choose the terms wisely)
- no exact numbers about use cases, those are classified and should not be disclosed
- keep roadmaps and timelines generic, not too many details 
- verify added content with the original sources and the resources in the folder "documentation/Fachliche Conclusions Open API Kundenbeziehung/Resources/original resources" and make sure to keep the content consistent with the resources
- if some information is not available in the resources, please use professional and reliable sources to fill the gaps, and make sure to document the sources properly

**General guidelines for the language:**
- even though the conclusions are written in german, please use "Ecosystem" instead of "Ökosystem" and "API" instead of "Schnittstelle" (this is a common term in the industry and should be used consistently)
- no ß, use ss instead (we are swiss not german!!)
- no emojis or slang, use professional language

[] update the file "Konklusion Open API Kundenbeziehung.md" that it matches the conclusions and the structure of the documentation
[] complete the file "Navigation Documentation"

**Priority list and order of task completion:**
1. Specific changes in conclusions 01, 05 and 07
