**complete professional documentation: conclusions in 8 topics**
professional documentation (conclusions) written from the perspective of an economics institute

**General guidelines for the conclusions:**
- keep the structure as is, do not change the chapters and subchapters without asking me
- make sure to add all sources and references to the file "Quellen und Referenzen"

**General guidelines for the content:**
- link references to other conclusions to avoid too much redundancy
- everything should be anonymized, so that it is not possible to identify the author or the company. replace names with generic terms like "Bank X","Financial Institution Y", etc. (it should still be clear where the perspective comes from so make sure to choose the terms wisely)
- no exact numbers about use cases, those are classified and should not be disclosed
- keep roadmaps and timelines generic, not too many details 
- verify added content with the original sources and the resources in the folder "documentation/Fachliche Conclusions Open API Kundenbeziehung/Resources/original resources" and make sure to keep the content consistent with the resources
- if some information is not available in the resources, please use professional and reliable sources to fill the gaps, and make sure to document the sources properly

**General guidelines for the language:**
- even though the conclusions are written in german, please use "Ecosystem" instead of "Ökosystem" 
- no ß, use ss instead (we are swiss not german!!)
- no emojis or slang, use professional language

**Additional sources as inspiration for best practice implementations and for the structure of the documentation:**

- https://docs.airlock.com/iam/latest/index/1639690251538.html

    - final conclusion file: "documentation/Fachliche Conclusions Open API Kundenbeziehung/04 API Endpoint Design.md"
    - make sure to use the exact data fields defined in the resources where applicable (1:1 mapping) and add any missing fields that are necessary for the API Endpoint Design
    - needs to be coherent with the Referenzprozess and the data fields defined there, make sure structure matches and that everything described conceptually in the Referenzprozess is then described in detail in the API Endpoint Design conclusion

**TODOs V**:
[] add missing graphics as outlined in the file
[] for each conclusion seperately: 
    - evaluate structure and content, focus on coherency and no redundancy and check grammar and general language, make sure it is professional and coherent
    - look at the mermaid graphs (online in github), make sure they are displayed correctly and readable (if not please add a TODO here so that I can fix it)
[] verify that the file "Konklusion Open API Kundenbeziehung.md" matches the conclusions and the structure of the documentation

Only if you have time to spare:
[] verify sources and references in the file "Quellen und Referenzen", delete unneccessary or unprofessional sources and if missing add link
[] color scheme to match Open Banking (see slides) make titles and stuff coloured or use to highlight idk
I added the hex codes for the most important colours here:
    - accent 1: #F85F3D
    - accent 2: #FA9F8A 
    - accent 3: #253165
    - accent 4: #2C495E
    - accent 5: #6695B7

**TODOs J**:
[] complete README.md file including graphics for our vision and some sort of navigation overview for the repo
[] create missing mermaid diagrams
