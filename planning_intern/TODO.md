# TODOs 

!!Read this file in detail to understand the tasks that need to be completed, the guidelines to follow and references to cosider, and the expected outcomes!!

## General Guidelines
- Analyze all relevant context thouroughly before starting any task.
- If you are even unsure about any task, ask for clarification.
- This project will serve as a core reference and is the foundation of developing a swiss open banking standard with the goal of creating a cross-industry standard for customer data sharing: the Open API Kundenbeziehung. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that all tasks are completed with the highest quality and attention to detail.

**Guidelines for professionalism:**
- this project represents the Open Banking Project Team as well as the Business Engineering Institute of the University of St. Gallen: work from a professional perspective keeping in mind that this is a research project and a core reference for the future of Open Banking in Switzerland
- everything should be written in a professional and coherent manner, avoiding any personal opinions or informal language
- ABSOLUTELY NO EMOJIS OR SLANG, use professional language only
- for german content: use "Ecosystem" instead of "Ökosystem" and "ss" instead of "ß" (we are swiss not german!!)
- differentiate between the documentation from a professional and theoretical perspective (especially Fachliche Conclusions) and the practical implementation and documentation from a practical and developer perspective
